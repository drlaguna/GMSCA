# GPCNA: Gene Pleiotropy Co-expression Networks Analysis

If we assume that genes are pleiotropic they can be involved in different biological processes, molecular functions, cell types, etc. Gene Co-expression Networks (GCN) are powerfull tools that allows us to understand the relationships and interactions between genes at transcription level. Using lists of genes well known for being cell-type markers or related to a biological process, we can annotate the modules (groups of genes) forming the GCN. The annotation process determines the enrichment of each module and the primary role of the genes included in it.

This R package includes functions to create GCN, annotate its modules, and to remove the effect of the principal enrichment of modules. This last function is the main contribution of the package and help us create a new expression profile in which it is possible to analyze secondary roles of genes.

## Example

The file test-data.rds contains an imaginary expression profile data set made of 20 samples and 1000 genes. Additionally, files A.txt, B.txt and C.txt contains imaginary lists of marker genes for three different types of cell. In order to analyze which genes have "C" as secondary cell-type lets do the following steps.

After loading the library we create a primary GCN from the data using createGCN.

> library(GPCNA)

> primary.net = createGCN( "test-data.rds" )

Then, we create a new expression profile removing the effects related to cell-types "A" and "B" using the function ```removePrimaryEffect```.

> data = removePrimaryEffect( expr.data = "test-data.rds", target.enrichment = c("A", "B"), net = primary.net )

Notice that we pass as third argument the network we have already created. Thus, ```removePrimaryEffect``` does not have to create it. 

Now, we create a secondary GCN using the new data set

> secondary.net = createGCN( data )

Notice that, ```createGCN``` is flexible enough to work with filenames but also with R objects. 

Now, we use ```getModulesEnrichment``` to take a look at the enrichment of both networks

> getModulesEnrichment( primary.net )

          blue red pink      magenta       yellow green brown turquoise black
          A 1.000000e+00   1    1 5.647068e-30 1.000000e+00     1     1         1     1
          B 1.000000e+00   1    1 1.000000e+00 4.206175e-25     1     1         1     1
          C 6.402609e-20   1    1 1.000000e+00 1.000000e+00     1     1         1     1

> getModulesEnrichment( secondary.net )

          blue green red yellow brown turquoise
          A 1.000000e+00     1   1      1     1         1
          B 1.000000e+00     1   1      1     1         1
          C 2.460543e-18     1   1      1     1         1

as it can be seen the secondary network shows that only the blue module is enriched and, in this case, by the cell-type "C". In fact, if we count the number of genes in module blue we can see that now there are more genes enriched by cell-type "C" than in the primary network:

> table(primary.net$moduleColors)

    black      blue     brown     green   magenta      pink       red turquoise    yellow 
      109       160       104       100        71        80        92       180       104 
> table(secondary.net$moduleColors)

     blue     brown     green       red turquoise    yellow 
      186       158       130       138       261       127 

In this case we can see that the expression profile processed to remove the effect of cell-types "A" and "B" has more "C" enriched genes than the original expression profiles. Concretelly, 186-160 = 26 more genes enriched by cell-type "C". Let's see now where they come from, i.e., what cell-type had those genes in the primary network.

> blue.genes = names(secondary.net$moduleColors[secondary.net$moduleColors == "blue"])

> changes = enrichmentEvolution( primary.net, secondary.net, genes = blue.genes)

```blue.genes``` has the name of the genes included in the blue module of the secondary network and using ```enrichmentEvolution``` we obtain a data frame with all the information we need. Thus, to see just the genes that has "C" as secondary cell-type we do the following:

> changes[changes$primary.enrichment != changes$secondary.enrichment, ]
